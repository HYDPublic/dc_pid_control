This firmware is meant for the DC motor solution of the v3.1 Satnogs Rotator with AS5601 encoder.
It was based on the source code from the satnogs-rotator-controller repository.
(https://github.com/satnogs/satnogs-rotator-controller roughly at commit d484c5249ea45e8c78a45f39fadb60a1163fa03c)

Required libraries
- PGMWrap (to store strings, not used at the moment) (http://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/pgm-wrap)
- PID (https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/PIDLibrary)
- SoftI2CMaster (http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/SoftwareI2CLibrary)

Main changes:

- based on Arduino PID Library (https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/PIDLibrary)
- using a 1KHz timer interrupt
- separated the AS5601 and motor control commands
- expanded serial command with debug commands

Some issues:

- AS5601 I2C communication uses interrupts so outside interrupt handler
- Using the V2 PCB without I2C multiplexer requires soft i2c for 1 chip
- Elevation rotor has heavy load and oscillates: needed 2 sets of PID parameters. 
  One set for local range, one set for large range movements.

Todo:

- integrate RS485 (now using simple uart to Arduino)
- cleanup command parsing
- add more safety checks such as current feedback sensing, non-movement etc.
- Add EEPROM stored settings instead of hardcoded defines
- Add a menu and a switch to edit stored settings on the device
