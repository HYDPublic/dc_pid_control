This test function I used to measure the stiction in the elevation axis.
Stiction is the force that is required to get the motor into motion. It is typically higher than the friction when the motor is moving.
Due to the heavy load I noticed that a significant part of the PWM range was not resulting in motion.
The PID controller then oversteers (especially I term). 
Therefor I add this static value of stiction in the motor control and let the PID control the remainder of the range.

The way the test works is that it moves 10 degrees, stops and then the motor power is slowly increased until motion is sensed.
That happens for all steps to 90 degrees and then downward. This could show any difference due to gravity.
However, in my case there was hardly any.
